# Setup Project

Perform initial project setup and installation.

This skill will:
1. Install all dependencies using `uv sync --all-groups`
2. Install pre-commit hooks
3. Verify the installation by running tests
4. Confirm the project is ready for development

Use this when first cloning the repository or after major dependency changes.
